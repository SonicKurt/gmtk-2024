Theme: **Built to Scale**

---

## Idea Board

What kinds of scales do we have in video games? What are the implications of scale in games? How can we use scale to create interesting gameplay mechanics?

### Attainable Scales

- **World**
  - This one confuses me. How do you scale down a world? Often the World grows as the game progresses. You want a point in time when the world grows so large that you feel like you can do anything. This idea most intrigues me, because I'm not sure how to make it work.
- **Time**
  - Something like *Superhot* where time only moves when you do.
Or look at any of the sci-fi movies where time travel is a thing.
- **Player**
  - Maybe you can transform into different sizes? This could come about by collecting different animals you can transform into.
  - Games like *Lego Harry Potter* or *Zelda and the Minish Cap* or that one Minecraft mod that lets you become mods.
- **Environmental Items**
- **Camera**
  - Maybe FOV or zooming in and out?
- **Physics**
  - Different areas could affect gravity, friction, etc.

#### Out of Scope

These just seem like they may not be as interesting or as easy to implement.

- **Economy**
- **Difficulty**
- **Narrative**
- **Sound/Music**

### Genres

Puzzle seems the easiest to implement in the time we have.

- **Platformer**
- **Puzzle**
- **RPG**
- **Strategy**

### Visual Theme

- **Pixel Art**
- **Low Poly**
- **Abstract**
